# Hospital-Readmission-Medicare-Cost-Analysis
This project examines the question: Is there an association between hospital readmission rates and Medicare spending? The results represent associations rather than causal effects, as the analysis is observational and limited by unmeasured confounders including patient demographics, disease severity, and social determinants of health.
