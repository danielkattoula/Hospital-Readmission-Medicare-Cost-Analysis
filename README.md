This project examines the question: Is there an association between hospital readmission rates and Medicare spending? The results represent associations rather than causal effects, as the analysis is observational and limited by unmeasured confounders including patient demographics, disease severity, and social determinants of health.

The analysis uses three publicly available CMS datasets covering 2,778 U.S. hospitals from July 2020 to June 2023. Key findings include a weak but statistically significant correlation (r = 0.169, p < 0.001) between readmission rates and Medicare costs, with hospital characteristics explaining only 7.8% of cost variation.

Repository Contents
The repository contains all files necessary to replicate the analysis:

analysis.R - Main analysis script containing data cleaning, merging, statistical analysis, and visualization
Hospital_Readmission_Analysis.pdf - PowerPoint presentation summarizing key findings and methodology
plots/ - All generated visualizations including scatter plots, boxplots, and diagnostic charts
Data Sources
All data obtained from CMS.gov (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services):

Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program - 18,510 records across 6 conditions
https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/dataset/9n3s-kdb3
Medicare Spending Per Patient - 4,627 hospitals
https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/dataset/rrqw-56er
Hospital General Information - 5,421 hospitals
https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/dataset/xubh-q36u
Reproducing the Analysis
To reproduce the results, the user only needs to:

Download the three CSV datasets from the CMS.gov links above
Install required R packages: tidyverse, dplyr, ggplot2
Update the working directory in analysis.R (line 9) to point to your data location
Run analysis.R
All data cleaning, variable construction, aggregation, statistical tests, and visualizations are automated through this script. The code handles format inconsistencies (leading zeros in facility IDs), missing values ("N/A", "Too Few to Report"), and merges the three datasets on hospital facility ID. The script outputs statistical results to the console and saves three visualizations to the plots/ folder.

Results
The plots/ folder contains three visualizations generated by the analysis:

readmissions_vs_costs_scatter.png - Correlation scatter plot with regression line and confidence intervals
spending_by_performance.png - Boxplots showing Medicare spending distribution across four performance categories
readmissions_by_ownership.png - Boxplots comparing readmission rates across hospital ownership types
The PowerPoint presentation summarizes the empirical findings, discusses study limitations (including low R², small sample sizes for some ownership categories, and inability to establish causation), and provides recommendations for policymakers and future research.

Key Limitations
Only 7.8% of cost variation explained by the model; 92% due to unmeasured factors
Cross-sectional design prevents causal inference
Readmission data aggregated across 6 different medical conditions
Some hospital ownership categories have insufficient sample sizes (n < 30)
No patient-level data on demographics, comorbidities, or disease severity
Findings should be considered exploratory and validated with more rigorous methods before informing policy decisions.
